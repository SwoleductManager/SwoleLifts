        <h1>About SwoleLifts</h1>
          <p>Sit down son, let me tell you about SwoleLifts and it's creator, SwoleductManager.</p>
          <p>So who tf is this SwoleductManager and what kind of wack name is that?</p>
          <p>You see, SwoleductManager is the combination of "swole" and "product manager", which embodies me. I started my swoleney (swole + journey) right after high school and had no idea what I was doing.
            I did not utilize any plans and just followed what other people were doing at the gym or watch Youtube videos. I had no set goals besides getting bigger and stronger.</p> 
          
          <p>Even in my freshmen year of college, my weight training was still inconsistent and not goal oriented. My diet and sleep were bad due to the nature of engineering classes.
            Sophomore year was where it all changed. The swoleness awakened in me when I came across gym bros lifting heavy ass weights at the university gym. That was when I came up with a semi-fledged plan
            and educate myself on proper nutrition.</p>
          
          <p>My main goals were getting stronger in bench, deadlift, and squat. I started following various powerlifting/strength/bodybuilding programs on the internet which helped my bench increase from 135lbs to 185lbs, 
            squat from 135lbs to 225lbs, and deadlift from 135lbs to 275lbs. There were times where I was inconsistent in my sophomore to senior phase due to assignments, late night studies, interview preps, interviews, and internships.
            Nevertheless, it didn't stop my swoleney.</p>
          
          <p>It was around the early stages of my career where the pandemic hit and all gyms were closed, halting my swoleney. At the time, I didn't have a home gym so I did what I could with what 
            I had (pushups, pullups at the park playground, running uphill, etc). It was also an opportunity for me to explore different directions of my career, which led me to becoming a product manager.</p>  
          <p>After about 6 months of excruciating pain of missing the smell of sweat and metal, the gyms re-opened again only to be closed 3 months later due to the spike in COVID cases. Thankfully I did 
            not get COVID as it was required for everyone to keep their masks on at all times even while lifting.</p>
          <p>That was when I thought to myself "How am I gonna gain entrance into the swole kingdom if I keep missing out on my daily swoledings?" and thus, I began looking around for deals for a home gym.
            Home gyms can be expensive, and I stuck to my main goals of getting stronger in bench, deadlift, and squat. So I focused on getting a power rack, barbell, dumbbell, weights, and a bench.</p>
          <p>I started my first workout stream on Twitch in August of 2022, where thousands and thousands multiplied by 0 (in case if you don't know, it's 0) of
            viewers were overwhelmed and astonished by my swoleness and how I handled the weights in the gym.</p>
          <p>There were some fellow swoldiers who seeked redemption to gain entrance into the swole kingdom. As the saying goes, "with great gains, comes great responsibilities". 
            With the gains, swoleness, and blessings that I've received from our Father, I shall share it with everyone else. Hence, SwoleLifts was born.</p>
          <p>After all is said, ask yourself:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Do you want to to start living a healthier and swoler life?</li>
              <li>Do you want to wake up everyday feeling stronger and swoler?</li>
              <li>Do you want to lift 8 grocery bags without panting?</li>       
            </ol>
          <p> If the answer is yes, then grab my hand and join me on this swoleney to the swole kingdom.</p>
