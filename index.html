                <p> <b>SwoleLifts</b> is a combination of workout programs from:</p>

            <h2>Where to get started?</h2>
                <h3>Programs</h3>
                    <p> <b>SwoleLifts</b> caters to all swole levels (beginner/intermediate/advanced):</p>
                      <ul>
                          <li>Beginners - I've never stepped inside a gym before nor do I even know what swole means</li>
                          <li>Intermediate - I can bench/squat/deadlift at least 135lbs with proper form</li>
                          <li>Advanced - I breathe, eat, sleep swole</li> 
                        </ul> 
                <h3>Equipment</h3>
                    <p>The equipment pre-requisites for any of the programs requires access to either a gym (LA Fitness, Snap Fitness, Anytime Fitness, etc) or a home gym with at least a power rack, barbell, dumbbells, and weights</p>
                <h3>Accessories</h3>
                    <p>Beginners - Since you're very new to the swole journey, I would advise you to spend as little as possible on equipment. Here's some recommendations to help you get started without breaking the the wallet:</p>
                      <ol>
                          <li>Straps</li>
                          <li>Wrist Wraps</li>
                          <li>Belt</li>
                          <li>Knee Wraps</li>
                      </ol>
                    <p>Intermediate/Advance - Here's the list of accessories that I use:</p>
                      <ol>
                          <li>Straps</li>
                          <li>Wrist Wraps</li>
                          <li>Belt (Lever, 10mm)</li>
                          <li>Knee Wraps</li>
                      </ol>
