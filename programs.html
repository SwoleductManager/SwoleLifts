        <h2>Beginners Program</h2>
            <h3>Equipment</h3>
              <p>All you need is just access to a regular gym (LA Fitness, Lifetime Fitness, Snap Fitness, etc etc).</p>
            <h3>Schedule</h3>
                <h4>Week 1 - Week 16</h4>
                    <p>Day 1(Monday)[Heavy] &rArr; Day 2(Tuesday)[Heavy] &rArr; Day 3(Wednesday)[Active Recovery] &rArr; Day 4(Thursday)[Light] &rArr; Day 5(Friday)[Light] &rArr; Day 6(Saturday)[Active Recovery] &rArr; Day 7(Sunday)[Rest]</p>
                    <p>After every 4 weeks, I highly encourage you to increase the weights according to the reccomended sets and reps you can perform. For example, on week 4 you can barbell bench 45 lbs without struggling and with perfect form.
                      You can try increasing the weight by 2.5/5/10lbs for safety. Please don't increase it by 50 or 100 lbs at a time. It can lead to serious injury.</p>
            <h3>Template</h3>
                <p>Day 1(Monday) and Day 2(Tuesday) are what I like describe as "Heavy" days. They consist of 2 parts:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Strength - Workouts that involves heavier weights you can lift for 5 sets of 4-6 reps, and 1-2 minutes of rest time.</li>
                        <li>Volume - Workouts that involves lighter weights you can lift for 4 sets of 8-12 reps, and 60-90 seconds of rest time. It targets hypertrophy (increase in muscle size)</li>
                    </ol>

                <p>Day 3(Wednesday) and Day 6(Thursday) are what I like describe as "Active Recovery" days. 
                  It is when you do movements that are less intense than the regular workout days and helps with increasing recovery.
                  Here's some suggestions:
                </p>
                  <ul>
                      <li>Jog/Bike/Swim for about 30 minutes</li>
                      <li>Foam rolling for 15-20 minutes</li>
                      <li>Yoga - I just find some videos on Youtube and follow along</li>
                  </ul>

                <p>Day 7(Sunday) is rest day! Yes, resting is a crucial part to getting swole.</p>
                <ol>

                </ol>
            <h3>What's next after completing this?</h3>
              <p>First and foremost, congratulations swoledier! It's one small lift for man, one huge lift for the swole kingdom. Keep up the swolecellent job! At this point, you should be comfortable 
                with most workouts/movements, stronger, and swoler.</p>
              <p>What you can do next is either re-do this program with heavier weights and incorporate different workouts/movements or move onto the Intermediate Program.</p>    
        <h2>Intermediate Program</h2>
          <p>Coming soon!</p>
