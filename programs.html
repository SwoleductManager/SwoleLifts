        <h2>Warmup</h2>
          <p>Warming up should be considered before starting any workouts. It's reccomended to warm-up for about 10 minutes. Here's some reccomendations ():</p>
            <ul>
              <li>jogging on treadmill</li>
              <li>jump rope</li>
              <li>walk up and down the stairs</li>
              <li>jumping jacks</li>
              <li></li>
            </ul>
          <p>A more detailed warm-up plan will be added in the future!</p>
        <h2>Beginners Program</h2>
            <h3>Equipment</h3>
              <p>All you need is just access to a regular gym (LA Fitness, Lifetime Fitness, Snap Fitness, etc etc).</p>
            <h3>Schedule</h3>
                <h4>Week 1 - Week 16</h4>
                    <p>Day 1(Monday)[Heavy] &rArr; Day 2(Tuesday)[Heavy] &rArr; Day 3(Wednesday)[Active Recovery] &rArr; Day 4(Thursday)[Light] &rArr; Day 5(Friday)[Light] &rArr; Day 6(Saturday)[Active Recovery] &rArr; Day 7(Sunday)[Rest]</p>
                    <p>After every 4 weeks, I highly encourage you to increase the weights according to the reccomended sets and reps you can perform. For example, on week 4 you can barbell bench 45 lbs without struggling and with perfect form.
                      You can try increasing the weight by 2.5/5/10lbs for safety. Please don't increase it by 50 or 100 lbs at a time. It can lead to serious injury.</p>
            <h3>Template</h3>
                <p>Day 1(Monday) and Day 2(Tuesday) are what I like describe as "Heavy" days. They consist of 2 parts:</p>

                        <li>Strength - Workouts that involves heavier weights you can lift for 5 sets of 4-6 reps, and 1-2 minutes of rest time.</li>
                        <li>Volume - Workouts that involves lighter weights you can lift for 4 sets of 8-12 reps, and 60-90 seconds of rest time. It targets hypertrophy (increase in muscle size)</li>

                <p>Day 3(Wednesday) and Day 6(Thursday) are what I like describe as "Active Recovery" days. 
                  It is when you do movements that are less intense than the regular workout days and helps with increasing recovery.
                  Here's some suggestions:
                </p>
                  <ul>
                      <li>Jog/Bike/Swim/Jump Rope for about 30 minutes</li>
                      <li>Foam rolling for 15-20 minutes</li>
                      <li>Yoga - I just find some videos on Youtube and follow along</li>
                      <li>Abdominal workouts</li>
                  </ul>
                <p>You don't have to do all of them. You can choose 2 or 3 of them.</p>
