        <h1>Warmup</h1>
          <p>Warming up should be considered before starting any workouts. It's reccomended to warm-up for about 10 minutes. Here's some reccomendations ():</p>
            <ul>
              <li>jogging on treadmill</li>
              <li>jump rope</li>
              <li>walk up and down the stairs</li>
              <li>jumping jacks</li>
              <li></li>
            </ul>
          <p>A more detailed warm-up plan will be added in the future!</p>

        <h1>Intermediate Program</h1>
          <h3>What's different from Beginner Program?</h3>
            <p>We will be introducing the following:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Progressive Overload - Progressive overload is when you gradually increase the weight, frequency or number of repetitions in your training program.</li>
                </ul>
          <h3>Equipment</h3>
            <p>All you need is just access to a regular gym (LA Fitness, Lifetime Fitness, Snap Fitness, etc etc).</p>
          <h3>Schedule</h3>
            <h4>Week 1 - Week 4</h4>
              <p>Example: [Barbell Bench 135lbs, 5 sets for 5 reps (5x5)], [Squat 135lbs, 5x5], [Deadlift, 135lbs, 5x5]</p>
            <h4>Week 5 - Week 8</h4>
              <p>Increase the weights by about 10%</p>
              <p>Example: [Barbell Bench 149lbs, 5 sets for 5 reps (5x5)], [Squat 149lbs, 5x5], [Deadlift, 149lbs, 5x5]</p>
            <h4>Week 9 - Week 12</h4>
              <p>Increase the weights by about 10%</p>
              <p>Example: [Barbell Bench 164lbs, 5 sets for 5 reps (5x5)], [Squat 164lbs, 5x5], [Deadlift, 164lbs, 5x5]</p>
            <h4>Week 13 - Week 16</h4>
              <p>Increase the weights by about 10%</p>
              <p>Example: [Barbell Bench 170lbs, 5 sets for 5 reps (5x5)], [Squat 170lbs, 5x5], [Deadlift, 170lbs, 5x5]</p>
              <p>Day 1(Monday)[Heavy] &rArr; Day 2(Tuesday)[Heavy] &rArr; Day 3(Wednesday)[Active Recovery] &rArr; Day 4(Thursday)[Light] &rArr; Day 5(Friday)[Light] &rArr; Day 6(Saturday)[Active Recovery] &rArr; Day 7(Sunday)[Rest]</p>
              <p>After every 4 weeks, I highly encourage you to increase the weights according to the reccomended sets and reps you can perform. This can apply to all 
                workouts other than the ones mentioned in the example above. Please don't increase it by 50% or 100% at a time. It can lead to serious injury.</p>
          <h3>Template</h3>
            <p>Day 1(Monday) and Day 2(Tuesday) are what I like describe as "Heavy" days. They consist of 2 parts:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Strength - Workouts that involves heavier weights you can lift for 5 sets of 3-5 reps, and 1-2 minutes of rest time.</li>
                <li>Volume - Workouts that involves lighter weights you can lift for 4 sets of 8-12 reps, and 60-90 seconds of rest time. It targets hypertrophy (increase in muscle size)</li>
